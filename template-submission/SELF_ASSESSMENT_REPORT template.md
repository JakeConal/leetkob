SELF\_ASSESSMENT\_REPORT.md — template

Every submission contains this file, at the root of the zip. Score yourself against **the rubric of that assignment**, criterion by criterion.

The total you write here goes into the name of your zip: `<StudentID>_<total>.zip`, or `<StudentID1>-<StudentID2>-<StudentID3>_<total>.zip` for group work.

What to write

\# Self-assessment — IA\#1

Submitted by: \<student ID\> — \<full name\> (group work: one line per member) Total I claim: 82 / 100

| Criterion | Max | I claim | Evidence |

|---|---|---|---|

| Contract | 25 | 22 | spec.md §Contract — endpoints, payloads, 3 status codes | | Acceptance criteria | 25 | 20 | AC1–AC4; AC4 has no concrete value yet | | Edge cases and non-goals | 20 | 18 | §Errors covers 4 of the 5; non-goals written | | Implementability | 20 | 14 | 2 behaviour questions came back: rounding, who may split | | Revision | 10 | 8 | spec-revised.md answers both, see the diff |

\#\# What I did not manage

AC4 ("limits") is still a wish — I could not decide the page size without

knowing the menu size, and I did not ask.

\#\# What I would do differently

Write the non-goals first. Two of the questions I received were about things I had already decided not to build, but never wrote down.  
Rules

\- **Evidence must point at something**: a file, a section, a commit, a test name. "I did this well" is not evidence.

\- The section _What I did not manage_ is scored as honesty, not as failure. An empty one on an imperfect submission reads worse than a frank paragraph.

\- The number in the file name must equal the total in this table. If they disagree, the table wins.

\- Your self-score does not set your mark — but an inaccurate one costs you. See _Honesty adjustment_ below, and in the rubric of every assignment.

Honesty adjustment

Your self-assessment is compared with the mark you actually earn. The gap is `your total − the mark`, on the same 100-point scale.

| Gap                            | Adjustment                                          |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| within ±10                     | none — this is normal calibration                   |
| \+11 to \+20                   | −3                                                  |
| \+21 to \+30                   | −6                                                  |
| more than \+30                 | −10                                                 |
| −21 or worse                   | −3 — read the rubric before you score yourself down |
| no `SELF_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md` | −10, and the file-name total is ignored             |

A criterion you claim with no evidence line counts as claimed-and-not-done for this comparison. The adjustment never takes a submission below 0\.

Scoring yourself honestly low costs you nothing inside ±10. Claiming marks you did not earn costs more than the marks would have been worth.
